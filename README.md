# Jaspers QR System
Preliminary collection of CAD files for my Jaspers QR system + eurorack case

![](/images/img001.jpg)

Pretty much all parts of this will be open source if I get around to document them properly :D

The QR clamp itself is not designed by me: https://makerworld.com/de/models/834960-quick-release-camera-plate-1-4?from=search#profileId-801040
but the jaspers clamp, the QR inserts and the case are.

Here are the components in their current stages:

Jaspers Clamp made to connect to the makerworld QR base with two M4 countersunk bolts + nuts: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/860ff2da090575b826f90c0c/w/a51714bde3f91bee691ecbfe/e/733bc1c6f1ebb1c11d8b2fc9?renderMode=0&uiState=6944276797c70086feb8bcc8

My Rackforge case shown in these images: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d60c4a23a6adca62ec9309f4/w/17a21127d0804b84b0fb1497/e/46652afa782f1171bf7ab269?renderMode=0&uiState=694427b277e09e6cb2014770 (You should be able to make it custom width using the variables)

These two are confirmed working, as seen in the pictures. I'm not sure if I'm allowed to share the custom QR plates, because I'm using the original 3D model from the makerworld page, and they don't allow remixes. I've filled in the holes on their model, and added two 3.5mm holes, spaced 18mm center to center. I think you should be able to take the original design and just use two M4 bolts (m3 are too small) and make the holes on my case design larger.

The basic rackforge parametric case: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/595d55fd1ee389b0452ffb13/w/7046bf9590a5bbb77d95e400/e/406176dd0c25979068e9e08e?renderMode=0&uiState=694427dd77e09e6cb201481b (Still a bit buggy at times)

The rackforge document if you need 25mm depth or less: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/de811473891da26a9f5e741f/w/0cdcac15c5206b2ec27288ca/e/3de1aabe4419d074cd9b68f8?renderMode=0&uiState=6944280d97c70086feb8bf1b (This fixes at least one bug from the original)
